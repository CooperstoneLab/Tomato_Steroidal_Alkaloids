## Title: Biosynthesis of Steroidal Alkaloids Are Coordinately Regulated and Differ Among Tomatoes in the Red-Fruited Clade
### Authors: Michael P. Dzakovich, David M. Francis, Jessica L. Cooperstone
### Summary

We quantitatively profiled and genotyped two tomato populations representing diversity in the red-fruited clade to address the lack of knowledge regarding the chemical diversity, concentration, and genetic architecture controlling tomato steroidal alkaloids.

We grew 107 genetically diverse fresh market, processing, land-race, and wild tomatoes in multiple environments. Nine steroidal alkaloids were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The diversity panel and a biparental population segregating for high alpha-tomatine, were genotyped to identify and validate quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with steroidal alkaloids.

Land-races and wild material exhibited higher alkaloid concentrations and more chemical diversity. Average total content of steroidal alkaloids, often dominated by lycoperoside F/G/esculeoside A, ranged from 1.9 to 23.3 mg/100 g fresh weight across accessions. Land-race and wild cherry accessions distinctly clustered based on elevated early or late steroidal alkaloid concentrations. Significant correlations were observed among early and late steroidal alkaloids in a species-dependent manner. A QTL controlling multiple, early steroidal alkaloid pathway intermediates on chromosome 3 was identified by genome wide association (GWAS) and validated in a backcross population.

Tomato steroidal alkaloids are diverse in the red-fruited tomato clade and their biosynthesis is regulated in a coordinated manner.

### Code
The code in this repository consists of the following:

#### Boxplots
Boxplots show steroidal alkaloid concentrations of the 107 tomato accessions.

#### PCA
Principal components analysis (PCA) scores, loadings, and scree plots are shown.

#### Hierarchical Clustering Solo & with PCA
Hierarchical clustering was performed and then the three main clusters were overlaid on the PCA to show groups within the red-fruited clade. The same was done for wild cherry tomatoes alone.

#### GWAS
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed. Code for these analyses will be pushed, shortly.

##### Manhattan Plots
Manhattan plots were used to show significant marker-steroidal alkaloid associations detected via the GWAS.

#### Correlation Analyses & Plots
Correlation analysis was performed to understand relationships between concentrations of the 9 steroidal alkaloids as well as any correlations with Total Alkaloid concentration. These were conducted both with isomers measured separately as well as summed. Wild cherry was again examined in particular.
